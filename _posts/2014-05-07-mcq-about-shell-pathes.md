1.  The shortest specification how to reach the desired object from the current working directory,  
    f.ex. <tt>"../../documents/book/chapter1.html"</tt>.
2.  The specification how to reach the desired object from the current working directory on an arbitrary path,  
    f.ex. <tt>"../../../bill/documents/book/chapter1.html"</tt>.
3.  The specification how to reach the desired object from the root of the filesystem,  
    f.ex. <tt>"/home/bill/documents/book/chapter1.html"</tt>.
4.  The specification how to reach the folder that contains the desired element,  
    f.ex. <tt>"/home/bill/documents/book/"</tt>.

**Three of the four given pathes point to the same file. Which path points to another file?**

1.  <tt>~/documents/book/chapter1.html</tt>
2.  <tt>~/documents/paper/section1/../../book/chapter1.html</tt>
3.  <tt>~/documents/paper/section1/../.././book/chapter1.html</tt>
4.  <tt>~/documents/paper/section1/../../.book/chapter1.html</tt>
