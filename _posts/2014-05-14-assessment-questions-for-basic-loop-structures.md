These questions assess understanding of the basic loop structres, as outlined in "[Concept Map – Loops by Isabel Fenton][1]"

**How does a "do while" loop differ from a "while" loop?**

1.  A "do while" loop runs a code block before evaluating a condition, ensuring that the code runs at least once.
2.  A while loop evaluates a condition after running a code block, while a "do while" loop evaluates a condition before running a code block.
3.  There is no difference; a while loop is a simplified version of a "do while" loop.

**Replace the blanks in the following javascript code with the correct numbers to have the loop run three times and display a famous catchphrase.  
**  
<span style="font-family: monospace, san serif;">var catchPhrase ="";<br /> for(var i=__; i<__; i++){<br /> catchPhrase+= " wakka";<br /> }<br /> alert(catchPhrase+"!");</span>
