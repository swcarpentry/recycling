My pitch, while not the best one, and definitely not the clearest one, was about motivating for learning design.

During one short, 10-15min lesson I'd like to show people what design *really* is about and the differences between good user interface and good user experience.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question:</span>

The **general** role of design is to:

1.  solve problems
2.  present something in a nice-looking way
3.  create easy-to-understand algorithms
4.  recognize and use good fonts, like Helvetica

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Second task:</span>

This window shows up when you're closing the text editor. Fix the picture so that the user experience is better (you can draw/write/etc on that picture):
