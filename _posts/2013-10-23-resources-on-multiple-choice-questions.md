Here are a couple of short handouts on things to watch out for when writing multiple-choice questions:

<div dir="ltr" data-font-name="g_font_32_0" data-canvas-width="282.0474227645874">
  <a href="http://testing.byu.edu/info/handbooks/14%20Rules%20for%20Writing%20Multiple-Choice%20Questions.pdf">14 Rules for writing multiple-choice questions</a>
</div>

<div dir="ltr" data-font-name="g_font_32_0" data-canvas-width="282.0474227645874">
  <a href="http://ctl.ualberta.ca/instructional-resources/instructional-techniques-assessment-guides/creating-multiple-choice">Creating multiple choice</a>
</div>

and a plug for [PeerWise][1], a system which has students construct their own questions for their classmates' use.
