Q1. Consider (Any language --- for this question, just using "print" to output)

int x = 6;  
int y = 12;

while(x < y) {

print "In the while loop";  
x+=2;  
y-=2;  
}

How many times is the statement "In the while loop" printed?

a) 1  
b) 2  
c) 3  
d) 4  
e) 5

Q2. Write "while" loop to repeatedly print the value of the variable z, decreasing it by 0.5 each time, as long  
as z remains positive.

N.B. You can use C++ or any other language you're comfortable with.
