**Novice from competent:**

to the top of an enclosing loop?

A) break  
B) continue  
C) pass  
D) return

**Expert from competent:**

What is the output of the following Python code fragment?  
>>> a=[3,4,5]  
>>> b=[5,6,7,8]  
>>> a+b

A) [3,4,5,5,6,7,8]  
B) [3,4,5,6,7,8]  
C) [8,10,12]  
D) [8,10,12,0]  
E) TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: list and list

On looking at this again the following morning, I'm not completely sure that the second question is quite competent-from-expert (maybe I'm not enough of an expert!). It certainly is higher-level compared to the first one, which is more of a "do you remember" type question.
