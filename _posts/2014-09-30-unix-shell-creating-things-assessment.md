mkdir a<br />
cd a<br />
mkdir b<br />
cd b<br />
mkdir c<br />
`

c)  
`<br />
mkdir a<br />
mkdir a/b<br />
mkdir b/c<br />
`

d)  
`<br />
mkdir a/<br />
cd a/<br />
mkdir b/<br />
cd b/<br />
mkdir c/<br />
`

2) From the working directory you started in above, what does `ls` show? What does `ls -F` show? Why did you learn only the latter in this lesson?
