I have written two multiple choice questions (MCQs) about Python dictionaries. Some of the key concepts associated with Python dictionaries are given in the <a title="Concept map for Python dictionaries" href="http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/04/30/concept-map-for-python-dictionaries/" target="_blank">excellent concept map by Jeremiah Lant</a>.

1.  Which of the following is not a valid dictionary key: 
    *   `"_hello_world_"`
    *   `-1`
    *   `("alice", "bob")`
    *   `["alice"]`
2.  Consider a dictionary defined by: `d = {"A":8, "B":5}`. The statement `d["A"] = "Hello"` will: 
    *   Add a new key-value pair `"A":"Hello"` to the dictionary.
    *   Overwrite the value already associated with `"A"` such that the key-value pair `"A":8` becomes `"A":"Hello"`
    *   Merge the value already associated with `"A"` with the value `"Hello"` to form a list of values, such that the key-value pair `"A":8` becomes `"A":[8, "Hello"]`.
    *   Cause a TypeError.

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
