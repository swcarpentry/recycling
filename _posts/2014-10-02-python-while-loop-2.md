Q1:

Which of the following is correct for a python “while-loop”?  
1. “while-loop” is preferred over “for-loops”  
2. “while-loop runs until the condition become “false”  
3. It is not necessary to test the code to see if the Boolean test becomes false at some point.  
4. “while-loop” can only iterate over collection of things

Q2:

I am watching my weight and want to reduce my weight from 170 lb to 155lb. I am trying to make a simple python code that would show me my weight loss by one pound every day and when it reaches 155, it should tell me that I have reached my goal.  
Here is the code that I wrote and why is this not going to work (don’t run the code)?

`weight = 170`

`while weight > 155:`

`   `

`   print(weight)`  
`   weight = weight + 1`

`print('your weight is ideal.')`
