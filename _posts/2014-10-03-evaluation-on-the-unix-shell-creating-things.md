Q1: If you are to remove a directory called 'thesis' under your home location (i.e. ~/), what command should you apply? (Assume when you type 'pwd', you get '~/thesis' and the directory contains various files like myThesis.pdf, result.txt, img1.png etc.)

1.  rmdir thesis
2.  rm -r thesis
3.  rmdir .
4.  rm -r ~/thesis
5.  None of the above

Q2: The command \_____ is equivalent to 'mv ~/fruits/apple.png .'

(Hint: can you use multiple commands to have the same effect i.e. move operation.)
