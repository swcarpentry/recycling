Here is my attempt.

**Novice/Competent**

xs is a numpy array.  Which command sets all but the first and last values in xs to 0?

*   A --- xs[0:-2] = 0
*   B ---  xs[1:-2] = 0
*   C --- xs[0:-1] = 0
*   D ---  xs[1:-1] = 0

**Competent/Expert**

ys is a numpy array with shape (3,2,3)

xs is another numpy array, and we would like to add them by:

> zs = xs + ys

Which one of the following shapes is valid for xs?

*   A --- (3,2)
*   B --- (3,2,1)
*   C --- (3,3,3)
*   D --- (3,2,3,3)
