1) From the following python definition what is the result of "foo(5)"?

     def foo(x):
         a = 1 + x
         b = 2.5 * a
         c = b / 2
         return c
    

a) 5  
b) 6  
c) 7  
d) 7.5

2) Write a definition that computes the polynomial (x^3 + 3 --- 2*x^-2) and prints "The answer is y units." where y is the value of the evaluated polynomial *without* returning a value.
