This is both my favourite type of Python question and a multiple choice. I will add another favourite type later:

`<br />
def name (x, y):<br />
&emsp;&emsp;y = x + 2<br />
&emsp;&emsp;x = 3<br />
&emsp;&emsp;return y</p>
<p>x = 2<br />
y = 3<br />
a = name(y, x)<br />
b = x<br />
`

What is the value of a?  
a. 2  
b. 3  
c. 4  
d. 5

What is the value of b?  
a. 2  
b. 3  
c. 4  
d. 5
