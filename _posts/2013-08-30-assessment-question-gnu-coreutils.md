I will keep the topic I choose for my concept map. GNU Coreutils.

**To distinguish novices from competent:**

The GNU Coreutils is a colection of tools for a Unix-like shell to manager  
files that in a few cases is incompatible with the POSIX standard.

Select the option below that give a valid shell command using ONLY tools of  
the GNU Coreutils for the desired action:

1.  output the first 10 lines of the file \`sample.txt\`
2.  list the content of $HOME with the permissions
3.  remove the non-empty directory \`sample\`<table border=1> 

</table> 
**To distinguish competent from experts:**

The rm command of GNU Coreutils with the flag \`-rf\` must be used with  
caution.

Select the option below that give a valid shell command using rm he desired  
action:

1.  remove the file name \`-rf .\`
2.  remove the directory name \`sample ~\`<table border=1> 

</table>
