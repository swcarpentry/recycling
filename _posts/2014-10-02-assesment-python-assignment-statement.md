1) Given the following program:

distance = 100 # miles  
speed = 50 # miles per hour  
time = distance/speed  
distance = 200  
print(distance, speed, time)

What will the program print?

a) 100, 50, 2  
b) 200, 50, 2  
c) 200, 50, 4

2) Chose one line from each of the following pairs of lines and number them in the order they should be arranged so that the resulting program will print the average of 5, 7, and 9.

print(d)  
print(a, b, c)

a = 5  
a = 5 + 7

d = (a + b) / 2  
d = b / 3

b = a + 9  
b = 7 + 9
