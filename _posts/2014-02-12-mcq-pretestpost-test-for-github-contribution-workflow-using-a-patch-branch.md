Context; Learning goal is to be able to work locally, using a special patch branch, to contribute fixing of an issue to an open source project. An example of a repo with tichets is our own [https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/issues][1] .  For the concept map of the course syllabus, see [http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2014/01/22/concept-map-github-contribute-to-an-upstream-on-a-patch-branch/][2]

1.  
MCQ (*Multiple Choice Question*) to differentiate whether or not the prerequisites are met.

Q: What is usually the next step after doing a git fork in order to start working locally?  
a.Git wget  
b.Git clone  
c.Git copy  
d.Git checkout

2.  
MCQ to ascertain the course achieved its objectives.

Q: Which command is needed once you are done with your local branch work on a ticket and want to upload it to the desired destination, eg Github?  
a.Git remote push myBranch yourUrl  
b.Git merge yourUrl / myBranch  
c.Git clone myBranch yourUrl  
d.Git push yourUrl myBranch

Sorry, I forgot to add the Exercise at 2pm!

3.  
EXERCISE SAMPLE WITH 3 STUDENT_GAPS

Working on open source projects can happen like so.

1.See an interesting ticket;  
[https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/issues/300][3]  
Create template text for Etherpad for use in workshops · Issue #300 · swcarpentry/bc

2.On Github, sign in and Fork it.

3.Go to your source folder and bring it down.  
$ cd src/

<ENTER How to get the code from Github?>

4.Go into the working folder and check that your remote matches your github info and that you're on the right branch.

$ cd swcarpentrybc/

$ git remote -v  
origin    https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/bc (fetch)  
origin    https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/bc (push)

<ENTER How to see what branch you're on?>

5.Make a nice new branch that references the ticket number and simultaneously check it out.

$ git checkout -b issue-300-etherpad-howto  
Switched to a new branch 'issue-300-etherpad-howto'

$ git branch ---all  
* issue-300-etherpad-howto  
master  
remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master  
remotes/origin/gh-pages  
remotes/origin/master

$ git status  
\# On branch issue-300-etherpad-howto  
nothing to commit, working directory clean

6.Do your work, commit it locally, and check your patch with diff.  
$ bbedit etherpad.txt  
$ git add -A  
$ git commit -m "#300 Etherpad file added."

$ git diff HEAD HEAD~1  
diff ---git a/etherpad.txt b/etherpad.txt  
deleted file mode 100644  
index 566dc1c..0000000

No newline at end of file

7.Now upload your work to your github repo.

<ENTER How to move your code up to github.>

8.On Github, view your branch and send it to the open source repo for approval.

https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/bc/tree/issue-300-etherpad-howto

Click 'compare and pull request'  
Ensure you see the green 'able to merge' sticker.  
Check the diff and write your comment. Include the ticket number in the comment with a hash sign!

9.Upon success, note that there is now both a ticket and a pull request, and each are separately commentable.  
[https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/pull/303][4]  
[https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/issues/300][3]

Notice how Github automatically linked the two.
