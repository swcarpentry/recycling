*A multiple-choice question to distinguish novices from competent practitioners:*

<pre>y = 3
def a(y):
    if y > 0:
        return y + a(y - 1)
    return y
print a(y)
</pre>

Without resorting to the Python interpreter, what do you think this program will print out when run?

1.  6
2.  3
3.  An exception will be thrown
4.  

*A "multiple-choice question to tell whether your audience has actually learned what you set out to teach"*

<pre>x = 1
def fun():
    print ''x is: %i'' % x
    x = 3
x = 2
fun()
</pre>

Without resorting to the Python interpreter, what do you think this program will print out when run?

1.  'x is: 1&#8242;
2.  'x is: 2&#8242;
3.  An exception will be thrown
4.  'x is: 3&#8242;

*A "short practical exercise they could do to exercise their new knowledge"*

The following code is an attempt to calculate n! (n! = n\*(n-1)\*(n-2)\*...\*2*1) for n = 4.  
However, it is broken. Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to not only fix it, but also to make it work for different values of n.

<pre>n = 4
def factorial():
    number = number - 1
    if number == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return number * factorial()
print '%i' % factorial()
</pre>
