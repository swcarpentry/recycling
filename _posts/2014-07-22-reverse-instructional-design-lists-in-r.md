QUESTION 1

Consider the list myList in R. Which of the following would correctly extract the object storing the lm() regression results? (Select all that apply)

<pre>a. myList[['reg']][[1]]
b. myList['reg'][1]
c. myList[['reg']][1]
d. myList[[4]][[1]]
e. myList[[3]][[1]]</pre>

QUESTION 2:

Not knowing about what the objects glm() and lm() return look like, how would you go about trying to extract the coefficients from both objects?

BONUS: Using one command, how would you look at all the coefficients simultaneously.
