<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Multiple choice question</span>

You are a collaborator on a project stored in GitHub and you already cloned the repository (nicknamed origin) to your local directory. You have been tasked with correcting a collaborators newly commited file (‘clinicians.txt’) and then re-sharing your modifications.

Which of the following protocols would you choose?

1.  git pull clinicians.txt; ****make modifications**; **git push clinicans.txt
2.  git pull clinicians.txt; ****make modifications**; **git add clinicians.txt; git commit –m ‘Final modifications’;git push clinicians.txt
3.  git pull origin master; ****make modifications****; git add clinicians.txt; git commit –m ‘Final modifications’; git push origin master;
4.  git clone origin; **** make modifications **; **git add clinicians.txt; git commit –m ‘Final modifications’; git push origin master

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fill in the blanks question</span>

In order to use the command line to set up a new Git repository from an existing folder on our computer (local repository) we would first use the git _\_\\_\_(1)\_\___ command to set up an empty Git repository. In order to connect our local repository to the git repository we use the _\_\\_\_(2)\_\_\_\_command, which requires two pieces of information; 1) the nickname for the local repository and 2) the URL. The files in our local repository can now be tracked using git \_\_\_(3)\_\_\\_\_, after which they are ready to commit and held in the \_\_\_(4)\_\___ area on the repository. Use git _\_\\_\_(5)\_\___ to send changes to the git repository and git _\_\\_\_(6)\_\___ to download changes. A collaborator may copy the git repository using the git _\_\\_\_(7)\_\___ command, but you will have to add them to the collaborators list on GitHub to enable them to commit changes.
